			Throughout the 1990s more and more buisnesses began storing personal information in digital storage systems. The Data Protection Act was put in place to prevent this personal data being used in inappropriate ways.
			<br><br>
			<i>The Data Protection Act</i> was put in place to keep any information deemed personal safe and private as well as insuring that any data held on you will be used lawfully.
			<br><br>
			These are the main princaples of <i>The Data Protection Act</i>:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Data must be collected lawfully.</li>
			<li>Data must only be held and used for reasons given to the person responsable for enforcing the DPA.</li>
			<li>Data can be only used for the purposes origionally stated.</li>
			<li>Data cannot be sold unless initally stated.</li>
			<li>Data held must be appropriat to the purpose that the data is held for.</li>
			<li>Data must be kept accurate and updated.</li>
			<li>Data cannot be held for longer than is absalutely necessary.</li>
			<li>Data must be kept secure.</li>
			<li>Data must be kept in regions with simillar acts in place.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br>
			With these rules in place many people can now be at ease knowing that their personal information such as hospital records and bank details are kept safe by the companies that they have intrusted their data with.
