		<p>
			<i>The Copyright Design and Patents Act 1988</i> has been put in place in order to protect the ownership of the original creator of a peace of digital work or media. Anything that you have created under this act is your copyright and so gives you full control over distribution. This means that a creator is able to prevent people ripping off their work or sharing it arround with a group of friends without breaking the law.
			<br><br>
			The <i>The Copyright Design and Patents Act</i> disallows people from sharing a peice of copyrighted work with a friend, selling or renting the work (without permision) or using the work on a network unless it is allowed in the licence. An important thing to remember is that when you buy a peice of software you don't own the software itself, instead you own a licence to be able use it.
			<br>
			Some copyright holders will go out of their way to prevent any of these things from happening by using specialised software that checks the work is only on allowed computers.
			<br><br>
			Some ways companies and copyright holders prevent software piracy:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An agreement is come to between the developer and the user that must be agreed to before the software can be used called a license agreement. Any breach of this agreement is illegal.</li>
			<li>Some software will require the use of a unique license key to activate or use.</li>
			<li>Some software will require the existance of a hard CD or DVD to run</li>
			<li>Some Software will require registration</li>
		</ul>
