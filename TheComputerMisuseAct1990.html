			Even with legislations such as <i>The Data Protection Act</i> keeping peoples data as safe as possible in the hands of companies, there are still a few issues that can come about as a result of malicious intent. <i>The Computer Misuse Act</i> is there to discourage potential hackers who might want to steal or modify your data with heavy fines and prison sentances of up to ten years.
			<br><br>
			The main points that <i>The Computer Misuse Act</i> are as follows as well as their respective punishments:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unauthorised access to digital material.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Up to six months in prison.</li>
				<li>Up to £5,000 fine.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Unauthorised access to digital material with intent to commit a further crime.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Up to five years in prison.</li>
				<li>An unlimited fine.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Unauthorised modification of data.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Up to five years in prison.</li>
				<li>An unlimited fine.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Making, supplying or obtaining anything that can be used for computer missuse offences.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Up to ten years in prison.</li>
				<li>An unlimited fine.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br>
